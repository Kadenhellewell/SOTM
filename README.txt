Instructions:
The opening screen has 3 part: number of heroes, number of villains (both spinners) and environment (combobox).
Select the number of heroes and the number of villains (between 1 and 5 each) and an environment. Then press start.
You will see several columns filled with characters. Type the name of each character into the empty text field.
Then, throughout game play, health can be adjusted for each character using the arrow buttons on the spinners.
New characters (sub characters) can be added to the game using the buttons next to each column.
These buttons will add new characters to each column.

Things to try:
First, not the dots that appear next to some of the characters. The blue dot appears next to the character(s) with the
highest HP and the red one next to the character(s) with the lowest HP.
Second, when a main character's health goes between 1 and 5 (inclusive), the fade transition creates blinking effect
which serves as a warning of low health. Once 0 health is reached, the blinking stops and the colors on the character
object turn red. The label on the character changes from Hero to Incapacitated Hero or from Villain to YOU WIN.
There are some circumstances in the game when health can go negative. When these happens, Heroes turn blue and villains
turn green (that difference was mostly just for fun).
Third, when a sub character's health hits zero, it is removed from the game.
Next, the conditions text field at the bottom left is for putting in various conditions that game adds on.
Lastly, you'll notice that sometimes, the words on the characters are hard to see behind the picture. If you click on
the words, they'll turn from black to white and vice verse to help them be seen a little bit easier.
If you want to play a new game or the current set up is incorrect, you can hit the reset button (bottom left). This will take you
back to the opening screen.
Note: notice that one the far right of the window, there is a text area. In this text area, an RSS reader gets input
from a website about the weather. Right now, it updates evey 5 seconds. This can be easily changed if desired.
